### Learning Goals
- Strengthen comprehension of DRY JavaScript and master event delegation
- Differentiate between the data model and its representation on the DOM
- Apply a systematic problem-solving approach to break down complex tasks into manageable steps

### Wins
- Successfully completed the project, allowing for additional time dedicated to refactoring
- Witnessed the transformation of the project from a basic wireframe with console.log statements to a fully functional interface
- Improved the interface for compatibility across various viewport dimensions
- Utilized external resources for custom token images (special thanks to Carman!)
- Conducted a successful code refactoring, enhancing purity and reducing redundancy

### Challenges
- Overcoming the challenge of building the project from scratch
- Strategizing the Data Model and Logic implementation
- Conducting effective code refactoring for improved DRYness
- Ensuring the display of tokens in the correct order based on player choices
- Implementing measures to prevent users from spam-clicking tokens
